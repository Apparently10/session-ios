# Session iOS

[Download Session on the App Store](https://getsession.org/iphone)

## Summary

Session integrates directly with [Loki Service Nodes](https://lokidocs.com/ServiceNodes/SNOverview/), which are a set of distributed, decentralized and Sybil resistant nodes. Service Nodes act as servers which store messages offline, and a set of nodes which allow for onion routing functionality obfuscating users' IP addresses. For a full understanding of how Session works, read the [Session Whitepaper](https://getsession.org/whitepaper).
